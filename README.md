Repository for the etch a sketch code project
Title - Etch a Sketch Project<br/>
Description - This is basically a pixel art kind of website, where you can doodle whatever you want with a few pixels displayed on the screen in the form of a grid.

ProjectLog[0] - First step is to make a grid of divs in the DOM. Working on that for now.
ProjectLog[1] - Update on displaying the grid, successfully am able to display the boxes in the container, all i need to do now is to figure out a way to display these boxes in a grid manner.
