Repository for the etch a sketch code project
Title - Etch a Sketch Project<br/>
Description - This is basically a pixel art kind of website, where you can doodle whatever you want with a few pixels displayed on the screen in the form of a grid.

ProjectLog[0] - First step is to make a grid of divs in the DOM. Working on that for now. <br/>
ProjectLog[1] - Update on displaying the grid, successfully am able to display the boxes in the container, all i need to do now is to figure out a way to display these boxes in a grid manner.<br/>
ProjectLog[2] - Update on displaying the grid, successfully displayed the grid as it should be, with a maximum number of boxes per row limited to 16. As of now working on the hover effect and remove grid or reset grid functionality of the project.<br/>
ProjectLog[3] - Successfully implemented the hover effect for the grid boxes, when the background color of the boxes change, on hovering of the mouse on the boxes.
ProjectLog[4] - Changed the hover effect to a mousedown effect, now the background color for the boxes changes when a mousedown event occurs.
ProjectLog[5] - Successfully implemented the reset grid button and removed the reset grid button, since i couldn't find a suitable use for it in the project.
ProjectLog[6] - Working on the change grid function. This function would change the dimensions of the grid, when the button is pressed.
